## Welcome!

This is a short tutorial that will demonstrate plotting several common types of graphs in R using the `ggplot2` package.

To follow along with the workshop in R, you will need to have **already installed** R and R Studio.

---

## How to follow along and participate

* Open R Studio

    + In R Studio, install the `tidyverse` package using the `Tools` menu and `Install packages...` menu choice 

    + Type the name of the package, `tidyverse`, in the dialog box that opens

* Open the workshop R Markdown file and click on the little green arrow at the top of code chunk that contains this: 

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(package = "tidyverse")
```

* The arrow will run all the code in that "chunk" of code

* Throughout the workshop you will be able to run the code from the demonstration by clicking the arrow on the top right in the corresponding code chunk

* In between code chunks, you can type as you would in a Word document if you'd like to take notes

* For the exercises you may have to finish the code yourself and then click the arrow to get the anticipated result

---

## Why are we doing this?

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = 600, fig.align='center'}
   knitr::include_graphics('./eda-party.png')
```

---

## The data set

* We will be using a built-in R data set containing data from Star Wars characters

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = 600, fig.align='center'}
   knitr::include_graphics('./yoda-mouth-open.jpg')
```

---

## Examine the full data set

* Get to know the data by running the code chunk that contains the name of the data:

```{r}
starwars
```

---

## Exploring the variables in the data set

```{r}
# change data types & subset data set to remove lists
starwarsRec <- starwars %>% 
  mutate_if(is.character, as.factor) %>% 
  select(-films, -vehicles, -starships)

# summarize updated data set
summary(starwarsRec)
```

---

## Using the ggplot2 package for plotting

* Part of the `tidyverse` set of packages in R

* `gg` stands for **grammar** of **graphics**

* Plots created in `ggplot2` are built in layers 

* Let's look at some examples

* First, a bar chart...

---

`r chunk_reveal("my_bar", widths = c(1,1), title = "## Basic bar chart")`

```{r my_bar, include = FALSE}
starwars %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gender)) +
  geom_bar() 
```

---

`r chunk_reveal("my_bar_fancy", widths = c(1,1), title = "## Fancy bar chart")`

```{r my_bar_fancy, include = FALSE}
starwars %>%
  drop_na(gender) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = gender)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "#7463AC") +
  labs(x = "Character Gender",
       y = "Frequency",
       title = "Gender of Star Wars Characters") +
  theme_minimal()
```

---

## You Try it!

Make a bar chart of the Sex of Star Wars Characters with the Figure 1 code in your R Markdown file.

Note that there is a line of recoding to update some out-of-date terminology.

Edit the code to: 

* Change the color of the bars by replacing #7463AC the name of your favorite color (e.g., orange) or using a color found on the <a href = "https://colorbrewer2.org/">https://colorbrewer2.org/</a> website

* Add labels for the axes and a title inside the quote marks

* Try another theme, you can find them here: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html

When you have completed the changes, click the little green arrow on the top right of the code chunk to run the code.

## Figure 1 code 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = 600, fig.align='center'}
   knitr::include_graphics('./this-is-the-way.jpg')

---

## You Try it!

* Copy and paste the bar chart code for the Gender and Height of Star Wars Characters to the code chunk for Gender and Mass under the Figure 3 code section in your R Markdown file. 

* Replace "height" with "mass" throughout the code. 

* Add labels for the x and y axes and a title. 

* Use `fill =` inside the parentheses with some color name or number to add a color in the `geom_col()` layer. 

* Add a theme layer with any theme you want to try.
